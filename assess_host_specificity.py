In order to analyse microbial specificity patterns on lower host taxonomic ranks, we determined “host-specific ASVs”,
defined as those occurring only in one sample group of a given host taxonomic rank (Fig. 3e; e.g., occurring in one host
species/genus/family/order/class only), and lacking in the environmental reference samples.
